# Bunnygram üêáüì¨

Effortless task scheduling for Next.js

## Introduction

Bunnygram is a task scheduler for Next.js. You might need one if you want to defer a computationally expensive or long-running task in the background.

You can choose from multiple adapters, including [QStash](https://docs.upstash.com/qstash), with more coming soon.

It borrows from patterns introduced by a similar library [Quirrel](https://github.com/quirrel-dev/quirrel), which was one of the first to make adding task/job queues to Next.js more developer friendly.

## Install

```sh
pnpm add bunnygram
```

You can also use `yarn` or `npm`.

## Setup

Suppose you wanted to send your user an email when they signed up. Here's how you can kick off the email job in the background with Bunnygram:

### Step 1: Define your scheduler

Put your scheduler definition somewhere e.g. `tasks/send-email.ts`:

```ts
// tasks/send-email.ts

import { Scheduler } from "bunnygram";

interface JobPayload {
  emailAddress: string;
}

interface JobResponse {
  status: boolean;
}

export const sendEmail = Scheduler<JobPayload, JobResponse>({
  // the path this API route will be accessible on
  route: "/api/send-email",
  config: {
    // ... optional config
    // if you're just testing on localhost, you also need to supply the baseUrl here:
    baseUrl: "http://localhost:3000",
  },
});
```

A few important things to note here:

- Notice how we specify the payload and response for the job we are about to write (more on that in step 2). This allows for better intellisense.
- We specify the API route the scheduler will be available on.
- There is some optional config. Crucially, if you are testing on `localhost` you have to specify the `baseUrl` explicitly.
