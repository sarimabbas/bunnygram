# FAQ

### How many times can I call my job?

As many times as the adapter's service allows. For e.g. QStash has their [pricing available here](https://upstash.com/#section-pricing).

### How long can my job run for?

Your job is run inside a Next.js API route.

If you deployed your Next.js app to a "serverful" provider e.g. AWS, Render or Railway, these API routes usually don't have any hard timeout beyond that which you set.

If you deployed your Next.js app to a "serverless" provider e.g. Vercel or Netlify, these API routes usually have a timeout, usually a couple of minutes. You can consult their documentation for the exact numbers.

### How does Bunnygram work?

Conceptually, Bunnygram is straighforward. It instantiates a Next.js API handler and another function to invoke it. It abstracts away some of the boilerplate regarding parsing request bodies, providing type safety and so on.

The flow of data is as follows. The `send()` function (introduced in other pages of these docs) sends a `POST` request with your payload to your adapter's backend e.g. QStash. That backend will then forward that payload by sending another `POST` request to the API handler. The handler will receive the data in `onReceive()` and run your job with it.
