# FAQ

### How many times can I call my job?

As many times as the adapter's service allows. For e.g. QStash has their [pricing available here](https://upstash.com/#section-pricing).

### How long can my job run for?

Your job is run inside a Next.js API route.

If you deployed your Next.js app to a "serverful" provider e.g. AWS, Render or Railway, these API routes usually don't have any hard timeout beyond that which you set.

If you deployed your Next.js app to a "serverless" provider e.g. Vercel or Netlify, these API routes usually have a timeout, usually a couple of minutes. You can consult their documentation for the exact numbers.
