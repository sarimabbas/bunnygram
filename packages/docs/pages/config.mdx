# Config

This page goes over the configuration options for the `makeConfig` function.

```ts
import { makeConfig } from "bunnygram";

interface JobPayload {}
interface JobResponse {}

export const schedulerConfig = makeConfig<JobPayload, JobResponse>({
  route,
  baseUrl,
  adapter,
  validator,
});
```

## `route`

This is a required property. This helps both the `send()` and `onReceive()` functions communicate with each other. This is the relative path to an API route e.g. `/api/send-email` or `/api/do-some-expensive-task`.

Note that: `baseUrl` + `route` = the full URL that `send()` will send your payload to. More on `baseUrl` below.

## `baseUrl`

If your app is hosted on Vercel, Bunnygram will try to guess your `baseUrl`. Otherwise if your app is deployed to another host, or you are testing on `localhost`, you should set the `baseUrl` manually in the config. You might want to set the URL conditionally in dev/prod based on `process.env`. You can see an example of how to do that in the [Basic adapter](/adapters/basic) docs.

Note that most adapters (except for the Basic adapter) won't work when testing on `localhost`, since these services have no way of talking to your `localhost`. To overcome this limitation, you can use `ngrok`, `tailscale` etc. which can help expose your computer to the internet.

## `adapter`

Which adapter you'd like to use with Bunnygram. By default this is the [Basic adapter](/adapters/basic). We recommend using another adapter instead. You can consult the adapter docs to find one that meets your use case.

## `validator`

You can add runtime type safety by providing a Zod validator to the config, like this:

```ts
// tasks/send-email.ts

import { z } from "zod";
import { makeConfig } from "bunnygram";

const JobPayloadSchema = z.object({
  emailAddress: z.string(),
  emailBody: z.string(),
});

interface JobResponse {
  status: boolean;
}

export const sendEmail = makeConfig<
  z.infer<typeof JobPayloadSchema>,
  JobResponse
>({
  route: "/api/send-email",
  validator: JobPayloadSchema,
});
```

The validator will be run inside both `send()` and `onReceive()` to make sure that the received data conforms to the expected type.
