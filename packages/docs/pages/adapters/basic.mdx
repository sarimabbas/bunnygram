# Basic adapter

The basic adapter is the **default** adapter when none is specified. It is intended for testing purposes only (e.g. on `localhost`, or when your app is not hosted on a publicly accessible URL).

The basic adapter is simply a request forwarder. The `Scheduler().send()` will just make a direct `POST` request to `Scheduler().onReceive()` at the specified route.

Using the [QStash adapter](/adapters/qstash) is recommended instead, so that you can control retries, delays etc.

## Using the basic adapter

Put your scheduler definition somewhere e.g. `tasks/send-email.ts`:

```ts
// tasks/send-email.ts

import { Scheduler, BasicAdapter } from "bunnygram";

interface JobPayload {
  emailAddress: string;
}

interface JobResponse {
  status: boolean;
}

export const sendEmail = Scheduler<JobPayload, JobResponse>({
  route: "/api/send-email",
  adapter: BasicAdapter(),
});
```

And you're done! All other steps should be the same as in [Getting started](/).

### Conditionally using the basic adapter on `localhost`

If your app is on `localhost` or does not have a publicly accessible URL, you may wish to conditionally use the basic adapter:

```ts
// tasks/send-email.ts

import { Scheduler, BasicAdapter, QStashAdapter } from "bunnygram";

interface JobPayload {
  emailAddress: string;
}

interface JobResponse {
  status: boolean;
}

export const sendEmail = Scheduler<JobPayload, JobResponse>({
  route: "/api/send-email",
  adapter:
    process.env.NODE_ENV === "development" ? BasicAdapter() : QStashAdapter(),
  config: {
    baseUrl:
      process.env.NODE_ENV === "development"
        ? "http://localhost:3000"
        : undefined, // ðŸ‘ˆ leave undefined if you still want Bunnygram to guess your `baseUrl`
  },
});
```
