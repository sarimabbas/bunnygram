# Basic adapter

The basic adapter is intended for testing purposes only (e.g. on `localhost`). It is the default adapter when none is specified.

The basic adapter is simply a request forwarder. The `Scheduler().send()` will just make a direct `POST` request to `Scheduler().onReceive()` at the specified route.

Using the [QStash adapter](/adapters/qstash) is recommended instead, so that you can control retries, delays etc.

## Using the basic adapter

Put your scheduler definition somewhere e.g. `tasks/send-email.ts`:

```ts
// tasks/send-email.ts

import { Scheduler, BasicAdapter } from "bunnygram";

interface JobPayload {
  emailAddress: string;
}

interface JobResponse {
  status: boolean;
}

export const sendEmail = Scheduler<JobPayload, JobResponse>({
  // the path this API route will be accessible on
  route: "/api/send-email",
  config: {
    // ... optional config
    // if you're just testing on localhost, you also need to supply the baseUrl here:
    baseUrl: "http://localhost:3000",
  },
  adapter: BasicAdapter(),
});
```
