# Make your own

Making your own adapter is straightforward. An adapter must implement the following interface:

```ts
interface IAdapter<JP> {
  /**
   * Verifies the signature of the incoming request
   */
  verify: IAdapterVerify;

  /**
   * Sends the payload to the backend
   */
  send: IAdapterSend<JP>;
}
```

Here, `JP` is a generic which refers to the type of the job payload. You can use the existing adapters on GitHub as a guide. Otherwise, here is a minimal reference:

```ts
const MyAdapter = <JP>(): IAdapter<JP> => {
  return {
    verify: async (verifyProps) => {
      const { rawBody, req } = verifyProps;
      return {
        verified: true,
        message: "LGTM 👍",
      };
    },
    send: async (sendProps) => {
      const { payload, url } = sendProps;
      console.log(payload, url);
    },
  };
};
```
