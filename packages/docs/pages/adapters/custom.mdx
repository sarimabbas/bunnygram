# Make your own

Making your own adapter is straightforward. An adapter must implement the following interface:

```ts
interface IAdapter<JP> {
  /**
   * Verifies the signature of the incoming request
   */
  verify: IAdapterVerify;

  /**
   * Sends the payload to the backend
   */
  send: IAdapterSend<JP>;
}
```

Here, `JP` is a generic which refers to the type of the job payload. You can use the existing adapters on GitHub as a guide. Otherwise, here is a minimal reference:

```ts
const MyAdapter = <JP>(): IAdapter<JP> => {
  return {
    verify: async (verifyProps) => {
      const { rawBody, req } = verifyProps;
      return {
        verified: true,
        message: "LGTM 👍",
      };
    },
    send: async (sendProps) => {
      const { payload, url } = sendProps;
      console.log(payload, url);
    },
  };
};
```

## Runtimes

Your adapter should be resilient to running in different JavaScript runtimes e.g. browser, Edge runtime for Edge functions, and Node.js for serverless functions.

Here are some tips you can use:

1. Bunnygram exposes the current `runtime` as part of the `sendProps` on the ` send` function and `verifyProps` on the `verify` function. You can use that for conditional logic.
2. Even if you have conditional guards, you can still run into import errors if, for example, you have a Node.js-specific dependency and the import statement is read by the browser (or any other incompatible import combination between the runtimes). To prevent this, you can use [runtime dynamic imports](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/import). As reference, check the source code of the QStash adapter.
