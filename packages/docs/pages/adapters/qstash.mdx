# QStash adapter

QStash is the recommended adapter for use with Bunnygram. You can find out more about QStash on https://docs.upstash.com/qstash. Using QStash, you can configure retries, delays, cron and more.

This adapter wraps https://github.com/upstash/sdk-qstash-ts. Many thanks to the Upstash developers for building it!

## Using the QStash adapter

Put your scheduler config somewhere e.g. `tasks/send-email.ts`:

```ts
// tasks/send-email.ts

import { makeConfig, QStashAdapter } from "bunnygram";

interface JobPayload {
  emailAddress: string;
}

interface JobResponse {
  status: boolean;
}

export const sendEmail = makeConfig<JobPayload, JobResponse>({
  route: "/api/send-email",
  adapter: QStashAdapter({}),
});
```

## Required config

QStash requires 3 environment variables to be set:

- `QSTASH_TOKEN`
- `QSTASH_CURRENT_SIGNING_KEY`
- `QSTASH_NEXT_SIGNING_KEY`

You can find these in your QStash console. It is recommended to set them in your `.env.local` for local development, and on your hosting provider's dashboard for production deployments.

Alternatively, you can also pass the config in code:

```ts
export const sendEmail = makeConfig<JobPayload, JobResponse>({
  route: "/api/send-email",
  adapter: QStashAdapter({
    config: {
      qstashCurrentSigningKey: "",
      qstashNextSigningKey: "",
      qstashToken: "",
    },
  }),
});
```

## Send options

You can also set send/publish options for the underlying QStash SDK e.g. retries, delays. You can learn more about what each option does in the QStash docs https://docs.upstash.com/qstash.

```ts
export const sendEmail = makeConfig<JobPayload, JobResponse>({
  route: "/api/send-email",
  adapter: QStashAdapter({
    sendOptions: {
      callback,
      contentBasedDeduplication,
      cron,
      deduplicationId,
      delay,
      headers,
      notBefore,
      retries,
      topic,
      url,
    },
  }),
});
```
